This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles involving the CMD instruction and command sequencing.  The original Dockerfile attempts to combine pip installation and application execution using && within a single CMD instruction. This approach often fails because the shell context isn't properly handled. The solution shows the corrected method of using a shell script or separate CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions for better clarity and reliability.
